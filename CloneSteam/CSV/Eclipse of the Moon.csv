Detailed Description: ,Eclipse of the Moon is a VR Rpg game that introduces the FPS system as a basic combat method.  The purpose of this game is to enter a magic school and perform the player's ultimate goal by climbing the tower where various creatives and artifacts appear.    The player will be admitted as a special scholarship student at a magic school and will help the school president's several tasks While climbing the tower. The more you climb the tower the more powerful Creature will appear and block you. However you will also become stronger as you climb the tower and you will use a variety of magic to move forward    Join forces with everyone at the magic school to prepare for the upcoming day of reflux. That is your objective and your most important objective. Protect everyone.      Basic play:    Basically the main way of fighting in this game is to kill the enemy with a magic bullet. The magic types are Rapid-shot single-shot and explosive-shot and anything will greatly help you navigate your way forward. Of course strengthening the basic attack to the end is the fun of this game too so please enjoy it.    Be careful not to bring the enemy close to you. If you were allowed access you would suffer a lot. Aim through the sights and get rid of the enemy without a moment to come.    A quick reloading technique will greatly help you get through the game. Practice and practice.      Developer comments:    Eclipse of the Moon has a total of 112 scenes and more than 20 beautiful large maps. I would appreciate it if you could enjoy the scenery of each map and play it.    All characters in the game are adults.
